## 👋 Hey there! I'm Karthikeya

I'm a curious-minded **Data Analyst** from Bengaluru who believes that *every number hides a story*—and I love bringing those stories to life!

With a strong foundation in **SQL, Python, Excel, Power BI, and Tableau**, I transform raw data into insights that drive real-world business decisions.

🛠 From optimizing sales pipelines to decoding customer sentiment for the iPhone 15, and from hotel revenue dashboards to SQL-powered eCommerce insights—I build projects that are not just functional but meaningful.

### 🔍 What I love:
- Digging into messy datasets and finding gold.
- Turning dashboards into business decision tools.
- Writing clean code and cleaner visuals.
- Learning every single day.

### 🚀 Projects that define me:
I've worked on diverse, hands-on data projects that span industries, tools, and techniques—from dashboards to scraping to analytics storytelling. Here are just a few highlights:

- 🏨 **ITC Hotels Revenue Intelligence Dashboard (Power BI)**  
  Designed an interactive dashboard to analyze guest behavior across room types, booking patterns, and time frames.  
  Used DAX and Power Query to create clean visuals that led to actionable pricing and promotion insights.

- 🛍️ **Jenson USA Sales Optimization (SQL)**  
  Used advanced MySQL queries to identify underperformers and inventory gaps, streamlining sales efforts.

- 📱 **iPhone 15 Customer Sentiment (Python)**  
  Web scraped and visualized 150+ reviews to extract sentiment trends and key product feedback.

- 🍔 **McDonald’s Sales Dashboard (Excel)**  
  Analyzed 10,000+ transactions to guide operational strategy across regions and menu categories.


🎖 Bonus? I was a Junior Under Officer in NCC, leading 100+ cadets in multiple camps, I know a thing or two about discipline, leadership, flexibility and staying cool under pressure.
